Internally this is now:

  if (DBG_PORT) {
...
  }

And DBG_PORT is at the top of the class:

 public class GSMPhone extends PhoneBase {
    // NOTE that LOG_TAG here is "GSM", which means that log messages
    // from this file will go into the radio log rather than the main
    // log.  (Use "adb logcat -b radio" to see them.)
    static final String LOG_TAG = "GSMPhone";
    private static final boolean LOCAL_DEBUG = true;
    private static final boolean VDBG = false; /* STOPSHIP if true */
    private static final boolean DBG_PORT = false; /* STOPSHIP if true */

Does this "work" for javac 7?
