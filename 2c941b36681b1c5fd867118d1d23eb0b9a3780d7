I would integrate findMvno in with the existing createAllApnList.  Do a query based on mnc/mcc and then cycle through the cursor building the list of apns.  As soon as you get an apn that has an mvno_type and mvno_match_data that matches, I believe you want to throw out previous matches and then only accept apns with the same _type and _match_data.  This can be done in a single pass through the cursor list.

this should generate some sort of error - the apn database is corrupt!
