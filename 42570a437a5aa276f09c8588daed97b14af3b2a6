This is a little confusing to me, is this correct:


"EFiap, Efemail are Type 1 files that may contain as many records as the reference/master files (EFADN, EFADN1). Currently, mIapFileRecord and mEmailFileRecord use assignment and thus only save the content of the last record.

This change concatenates the records so the results are correct when there are multiple records."


Should check if the number of records match the "reference/master" files?

As per 3GPP TS 31.102 section 4.4.2.1	EFPBR (Phone Book Reference file), 
Type 1 files: Files that contain as many records as the reference/master file (EFADN, EFADN1) and are linked on record number bases (Rec1 -> Rec1). The master file record number is the reference.
Type 2 files:	Files that contain less entries than the master file and are linked via pointers in the index administration file (EFIAP).

EFiap is a Type 1 file. EFemail can be a Type 1 or Type 2 file. With this patch, all EFiap and EFemail records are added to the list instead of only 1.

No need to check as the error cases had been already taken care by catching IndexOutOfBoundsException

eg:
If there are 2 EFadn files with 250records in each file, then there will be 2EFiap files with 250records in each file. With out the changes in this patch, 2nd files records will override the 1st files records stored in mIapFileRecord.

Same applies to mEmailFileRecord if the EFemail is a Type 1 file.
