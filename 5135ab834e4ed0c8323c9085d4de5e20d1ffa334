In my testing I have to have:

  LOCAL_AIDL_INCLUDES := $(LOCAL_PATH)/src/java

Otherwise I get a compile error:

  frameworks/opt/telephony/src/java/com/android/internal/telephony/IIccPhoneBook.aidl:19: couldn't find import for class com.android.internal.telephony.uicc.AdnRecord

This is because AdnRecord.aidl is like "header file" and needs to be in the LOCAL_AIDL_INCLUDES list so IIccPhoneBook.aidl can find it (see: http://developer.android.com/guide/components/aidl.html).
Please add it back, or let me know how/why it works for you but not me.
