Can we please introduce  two more new methods  to get the below details ?

1. A method to get the phoneId by providing subscriptionId(like: int getPhoneId(long subId)).
2. A method to get the SubscriptionId by providing phoneId(like: long getSubId(int phoneId)).

1. yes, already provide on this fils getPhoneId
2. Now, the phoneId implementation is like the simId. Hence, there is a simple way to use long [] getSubId(int simId) right now. And you could use the first one to in your code

Can we please introduce a new public method getInstance() to return the SubscriptionController instance?

If any other classes in framework layer want to access methods on this class, they can do it by calling getInstance().

All function are static and no need to provide the getInstance at all. Should we?

Here I see functions in SubscriptionController are non-static, 

I think In SubscriptionManager.java we need to have getInstance() definitely.
Even if all functions are static, it would be good to provide getInstance() function, this helps in handling class members if at all any.

At this point there are any class members so things work, when you had to introudce certain class member it would be aproblem, static methods can't access that.

SubscriptionController having getInstance() is arguable one.

framework can use  ISub.asInterface()/subscriptionManager  to access the functions.

If at all if we want to expose getInstance() I think we need to have looper checks inside SubscriptionContoller so that it is accessed from phone process only. (similar to PhoneFactory.java)
