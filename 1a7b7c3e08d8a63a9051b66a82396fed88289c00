this isn't going to work.  You have a window between the two sync blocks in which someone can acquire a wake lock and inc the pending count and then you will release it when it shouldn't be.

The safe/easy way is to using a single lock object.  There may be another safe way to do it using two locks.  I'm not sure if the optimization of using two locks is worth it - take a look.
