Why does this need to be configurable?

When RIL gets an indication from WMS in the Submit Report that the network is not ready, it returns failure indicating retry.

This is because the network not being ready is often a temporary condition.  This can happen when the network releases the call in order to setup an incoming voice call. 

This fix has the effect of creating a delay.  Android will delay retrying the message for several seconds.  Currently the Android default delay is 2 second.

Hence, when the SMS cannot be sent because the network is not ready, there will be a delay of several seconds before the message is retried, the delay is configurable, and this should give enough time for incoming voice calls to be received

Not sure I follow:  when/how is this configured?  At build time, or do you plan to change this dynamically at runtime (ie, via the RIL, depending on specific error conditions)?

static final String PROPERTY_SMS_RETRY_DELAY = "persist.radio.sms_retry_delay"

from  https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/37643

This should be set at build time and NOT based on specific error condition.
